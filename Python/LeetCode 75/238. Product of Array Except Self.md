```python
def calculateLookUpTable(nums):
    # A bit hacky here but I'm assuming that the constraints
    # have a hand in this (-30 <= nums[i] <= 30).
    # Why don't we just calculate a value while avoiding each
    # number? It's a bit inefficient but assuming that we have
    # a lot of numbers it will be more efficient than O(n) in
    # the long run
    lookUp = {}

    for numberToAvoid in range(-30, 30 + 1):
        # We use a bool here to know if we've avoided
        # this number exactly one time
        avoided = False

        # We use an accumulator here to store the products.
        # Although it's tempting, we can't start with 0 like most
        # accumulators
        productAcc = 1

        for num in nums:
            # We skip the number if it's the one we need to skip
            # and we haven't already skipped it
            if not avoided and numberToAvoid == num:
                avoided = True
                continue

            # If any number is 0, the product will be 0
            # and we go ahead and break the loop
            if num == 0:
                productAcc = 0
                break

            # If all goes well, multiply the accumulator by
            # the number
            productAcc *= num
