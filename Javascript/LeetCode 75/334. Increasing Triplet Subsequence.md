```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var increasingTriplet = function(nums) {
    // Basically, we have a lowest number recorded, and a number to beat. If we encounter a number lower than `lowestNumberRecorded`, we set it equal to the new number. If we encounter a number higher than `lowestNumberRecorded` then we store it in `numberToBeat`. If the current number is above `numberToBeat`, we have confirmed that the puzzle condition does exist.

    // Say for example our `lowestNumberRecorded` is 8 and our `numberToBeat` is 11. If our next number was a 4, then `lowestNumberRecorded` get changed to 3. This still agrees with i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]. If the next number is 6, then we change `numberToBeat` to 6. We know that any number bigger than 11 will be bigger than 6, so we are not missing out on any possible combinations that work. If we eventually get a number higher than 6, then the puzzle condition does exist.
    let lowestNumberRecorded = nums[0]
    let numberToBeat = Infinity

    // We start at one index later since we are already using 
    // the first index
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const number = nums[i]

        if (number > numberToBeat) {
            return true
            continue
        }

        // We use <= instead of < so it doesn't drop down
        // and do the mutually exclusive check
        if (number <= lowestNumberRecorded) {
            lowestNumberRecorded = number
        } else if (number < numberToBeat) {
            numberToBeat = number
        }
    }

    return false
